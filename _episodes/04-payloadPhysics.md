title: "Running the Basic Analysis"
teaching: 60
exercises: 30
questions:
- What is the basic order of operations for building/executing your program with CMake?
- How do you access the data of the DAOD within the C++ code?
objectives:
- Start up the `AnalysisBase` Docker image
- Copy the AnalysisPayload code to loop over events
- Compile the payload to produce an executable program
- Run the executable to print out jet properties
keypoints:
- The directory where your source code lives and where you build the code are _two separate directories_.
- When in doubt, you can always remove the entire contents of your `build` directory.
- Information within the (D)AOD is organized in what is called the EDM.
- Compiling/linking ATLAS code "by hand" is super long.  Thank goodness we have CMake.
- Judiciously choose when to parameterize your ignorance.  It is a powerful approach, but remember **you are a smart human**, not a robot.

## Start up a container from the Docker image

Working from your shell create a directory on your laptop for the work you will be doing,
called `Bootcamp` for example and enter that directory.  This directory may already
exist from the previous section and need not be named `Bootcamp`.

```bash
mkdir Bootcamp
cd Bootcamp
```

Within this directory, make another directory named `Data` and put the DAOD file you downloaded previously into this directory

For example, moving the file over using the terminal...

```bash
mkdir Data
mv <DataLocation/File.root> Data/.
```

Be sure that you are residing within the `Bootcamp` directory and then start up the
container from the `AnalysisBase` Docker image.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/atlas/Bootcamp atlas/analysisbase:21.2.186 bash
```

This command is slightly extended from what you did previously.  It now includes this `-v $PWD:/home/atlas/Bootcamp`
option which will place the entire file structure of your current working directory within the `/home/atlas/Bootcamp` directory
of the image.  So when you immediately start the image, if you list the files in the current directory, you will see your data. 

Note that you may have to `cd` into your `Bootcamp` directory. 

```bash
[bash][atlas]:workdir > cd /home/atlas/Bootcamp
[bash][atlas]:Bootcamp > ls
Data
[bash][atlas]:Bootcamp > 
```

Again, you will learn more of these details on Thursday of the bootcamp if you are not familiar.  For now, what
this allows you to do is load the ATLAS environment as before, and then when you move into `Bootcamp`,
it is as if you were working with your local directory/file structure.  If you create or delete a file here,
it will be created or deleted on your laptop.

```bash
source /release_setup.sh
Configured GCC from: /opt/lcg/gcc/8.3.0-cebb0/x86_64-centos7/bin/gcc
Configured AnalysisBase from: /usr/AnalysisBase/21.2.125/InstallArea/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt
```

You should now see the `Data` directory which you created and the test DAOD file contained within it.

Create a file within `Bootcamp` called `AnalysisPayload.cxx`

```bash
touch AnalysisPayload.cxx
```

Open this file with your chosen editor, copy in the code below and then save. The `inputFilePath` may have to be changed to reflect the location of the VH sample within the
container, it should be something like `/home/atlas/Bootcamp/Data/<filename>.root` but
may be slightly different depending on the naming you chose for your directories
and when you booted up the Docker image.  Whatever the case, the file must reside **somewhere** within the directory
structure that is "linked" to your Docker image via the `-v` option.  You will learn more about these details later in the week.

int main() {

  // initialize the xAOD EDM
  xAOD::Init();

  // open the input file

  event.readFrom( iFile.get() );

  // for counting events
  unsigned count = 0;

  // get the number of events in the file to loop over
  const Long64_t numEntries = event.getEntries();

  // primary event loop
  for ( Long64_t i=0; i<numEntries; ++i ) {

    // Load the event
    event.getEntry( i );

    // Load xAOD::EventInfo and print the event info
    const xAOD::EventInfo * ei = nullptr;
    event.retrieve( ei, "EventInfo" );
    std::cout << "Processing run # " << ei->runNumber() << ", event # " << ei->eventNumber() << std::endl;

    // retrieve the jet container from the event store
    const xAOD::JetContainer* jets = nullptr;
    event.retrieve(jets, "AntiKt4EMTopoJets");

    // loop through all of the jets and make selections with the helper

    count += 1;
  }

  // exit from the main function cleanly

## Compiling and Linking

Now it is time to compile your code so you are able to have it carry out your analysis.  In this first example, we will perform this
build using the full `g++` command, to emphasize the fact that all that is going to be happening "under the hood" throughout the week
(e.g. when we start using CMake) can be done with a single call to `g++`.

To do this, within the `Bootcamp` directory, start by running the command that will prepare your shell environment by setting a few
paths necessary for `g++`.

~~~bash
source /opt/lcg/binutils/2.30/x86_64-centos7/setup.sh
source /opt/lcg/gcc/8.3.0/x86_64-centos7/setup.sh
~~~

Now you are able to run the `g++` compiler on your `AnalysisPayload.cxx`.  Yes, its long and quite esoteric if you are not familiar with
how the ATLAS codebase is organized "under the hood".  And indeed, few people are.  This is an example of a place where it is *totally fine*
to parameterize your ignorance and let someone, or something else, do the heavy lifting.  That something will be CMake ... soon, we promise.

For now, simply copy and paste this command into your terminal.

## Run executable

Alright, it is time to run this executable and if everything worked out fine, it should
print some output after looping over the events in the test DAOD file.  Hopefully you have
read the code and made a guess at what it will print out.  In this case, we are printing out
the basic jet kinematics `(pT, eta, phi, m)`.

Within the `Bootcamp` directory, run the `AnalysisPayload` executable.

~~~bash
./AnalysisPayload
~~~

If you have followed the instructions (and hopefully with no unexpected errors) you should get an output that looks something like this

> ...
>
> Processing run # 284500, event # 4940346
>
> Jet : pt=58884.9  eta=-0.728219  phi=-3.1079585 m=52.21
>
> Jet : pt=30194.4  eta=0.952566  phi=-1.2340236  m=86.78
>
> Jet : pt=25141.3  eta=-0.896951  phi=1.8794845  m=27.64
>
> ...
>
{: .output}

**Warning**: A common error here is that the path to the xAOD file is incorrect and your program cannot find it. Be careful to change the `inputFilePath` to reflect the path to the xAOD file on your system. 

As you can see, it is actually possible to compile and link your analysis code manually
to produce an executable that runs over your xAODs. However, it is fair to say that the
commands are ridiculously long and are prone to error. This example only accesses a jet
container and print some properties but it is already very complicated, imagine the commands
needed to run a full analysis framework.

This is why ATLAS software uses things like CMake and GNU Make which you will learn
more about this week but for now we will quickly convert our setup to use CMake to
compile in the next section. Go for it!
